# Train-Scheduler

Assignment for my Coding Bootcamp at Penn University.

It uses:

- Firebase for data storage
- Moment.js for time calculations
- Javascript for the logic
- jQuery for DOM manipulation


## How it works

The user can add trains and include the time when the first one arrives, as well as the frequency.

The app will calculate when the next train is due to arrive from the present time.
